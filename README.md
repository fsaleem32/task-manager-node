## Welcome 👋

Thanks for taking the time to work through this exercise!

We don’t expect perfection or a “finished product” in the short time you have. The goal is simply to see how you think, how you structure code, and how you approach a realistic problem. It’s completely okay if you don’t get through everything.

A few things to keep in mind while you work:

You’re encouraged to make reasonable assumptions if something isn’t fully specified.

There isn’t one “right” solution — we’re more interested in your reasoning than in a specific pattern or framework.

Feel free to leave comments or notes in the code if you’d like to explain trade-offs or what you’d do with more time.

Above all, relax and have fun with it. Treat this as a chance to show how you naturally work on a small but real-world backend feature rather than an exam.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

This project contains two separate applications:

- **Backend** — Node.js + TypeScript REST API (Express + TypeORM + SQLite)
- **Frontend** — React + TypeScript (Vite)

You must run **both** for the application to work.

---

## 📦 Setup

### **Requirements**
BE
- Node.js 18+ (or a recent LTS)
- npm
- Port **8080** must be free

FE
- NPM (or Yarn)
- Port 5173 must be available (default for Vite)

### **Steps**

BE
1. Navigate to the backend directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
2. Install dependencies: 

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server (auto-reload):

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
FE
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Project Overview

This project is a **Task Manager REST API** built with **Node.js + TypeScript** and an **SQLite database**.  
It lets you create, read, update, and delete “tasks” via HTTP endpoints.

### Tech Stack

- **Node.js (TypeScript)**
- **Express** (REST API)
- **TypeORM** (database access)
- **SQLite** (file-backed DB for local development)
- **React + TypeScript (Vite)** (for the frontend)

---

## Current API Overview

The backend exposes a simple REST API for managing tasks under the base path:

```text
GET  /api/tasks
Returns a list of all tasks.

GET  /api/tasks/{id}
Returns a single task by its ID (or 404 if not found).

POST /api/tasks
Creates a new task from the JSON payload and returns the created task.

PUT  /api/tasks/{id}
Updates an existing task with the given ID using the JSON payload.

DELETE /api/tasks/{id}
Deletes the task with the given ID (returns 204 on success).
```
